# stock-analysis
Stock analysis repository for class work on VBA
A new sheet was created and named as QD Analysis.
A macro was created titled  "DQAnalysis" to write in a title at A1 cell of the Excel sheet as "DAQO (Ticker: DQ)" and name three columns at Row (3, 1) as "Year", Row (3, 2) as "Total Daily Volume"; and Row (3, 3) as "Return".
Another macro was created titled "DQAnalysis2" to automate the same input the the rows an columns as "DQAnalysis" but using the Range method.
Both mactos are available on the Excel sheet ribbon at Developer tab>> Visual Basic tab>> Tools tab>> Macros.
You can toggle between the macros and change the text in the sheet by hitting the Run button.
